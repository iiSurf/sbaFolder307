TITLE: Four page website demonstrating my efforts with HTML and CSS
This website provides information about the web developer and two pschologists. In the future I plan to make a website like this but incorporate a calming game to relax you when you need it.

The way to run this website is you will need Google Chrome as that is what was used for testing. You may use other browsers but I can not guarantee how it will look with other browsers and/or earlier versions of your browser. This website was tested with browser Google Chrome Version 124.0.6367.119 (Official Build).

To run the files please download to your computer and use Microsoft Visual Studio Code, download Live Server from the Extensions library and come back to any html file and right click with your mouse and click on the menu item called open with live server. Then you are free to explore my website.

THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS THE ERROR PAGE IS TO CLICK ON THE LOGIN BUTTON IN THE NAV BAR AT THE TOP RIGHT PART OF SCREEN

All Images are my own taken by me except the superman image is from: https://postimg.cc/QKNcd2p8

REFLECTION: 

a. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
Start with all the requirements and then add the extra features later. I would start with the just the essentials mentality but then lose my way and accidently look in to features.

b. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
Tables for some reason were really hard to incorporate into the project. It would always move the background image to odd positions on a given web page. Even with using dispaly: flex; and all flex boxx attributes.

c. What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?

Scroll to top button would have been nice but for some reason it messed with my background image and I could't use it. Also need to add an application idea somewhere. Maybe another webpage would be the landing spot for that.

d. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.

Dedicate 15 hours per webpage in to planning next time. Instead of doing 50 hours of work in 4 days when I thought it would take 5-10 hours max.
