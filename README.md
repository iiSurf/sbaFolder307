TITLE: Four page website demonstrating my efforts with HTML and CSS
This website provides information about the web developer and two pschologists. In the future I plan to make a website like this but incorporate a calming game to relax you when you need it.

The way to run this website is you will need Google Chrome as that is what was used for testing. You may use other browsers but I can not guarantee how it will look with other browsers and/or earlier versions of your browser. This website was tested with browser Google Chrome Version 124.0.6367.119 (Official Build).

To run the files please download to your computer and use Microsoft Visual Studio Code, download Live Server from the Extensions library and come back to any html file and right click with your mouse and click on the menu item called open with live server. Then you are free to explore my website.
